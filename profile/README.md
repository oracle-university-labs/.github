## Oracle University Labs

Oracle University Labs is a collection of repositories that provide sample code, instructional examples, and hands-on lab materials designed to support learning across Oracle Cloud technologies. These projects are created exclusively for educational and demonstration purposes and are not intended for use in production environments.

Our repositories enable learners to explore Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) concepts through guided activity guides, hands-on labs, and demo-ready code samples. You can use these resources with:

- Oracle University paid lab subscriptions (sandbox environments)  
- Your existing Oracle Cloud account  
- An Oracle Cloud Free Tier account  

These examples will help you practice, build, test, and deploy applications on Oracle Cloud as part of your learning journey.
